ABSTARCT:
The rapid growth of Internet-based applications in e-commerce sites which leads people to generate a huge amount of opinions and reviews about their products and services. Hence we use Sentiment analysis on product reviews that involves natural language processing (computer program to understand human language) techniques and the objective of using Sentiment Analysis is to accurately extract people's opinions from a large number of unstructured review texts and classifying them into sentiment classes such as positive, negative, or neutral. This research provides an effective way to mine online product experience and track customerâ€™s demands, thereby strongly supporting future product improvement and marketing strategy optimization. It is divided into Fine-grained , Emotion detection, Multilingual and Aspect based Sentiment analysis. From the above mentioned types we focus only on Aspect based Sentiment Analysis where it involves breaking down text into smaller chunks, allowing more granular and accurate insights from data. With aspect based sentiment analysis, it can be distinguished which features of a product or service offering are liked and which ones can be improved. We develop a system that incorporates spam filtering, review popularity, review posting time and aspect-based sentiment analysis to generate accurate and reliable reputation values. These systems provide an overall reputation value toward the entity and disregard generating reputation scores toward each aspect of the product. Sentiment analysis may involve the following types of classification algorithms Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, RNN derivatives LSTM and GRU. This system makes E-commerce industry to better understand customers online purchasing decisions.
